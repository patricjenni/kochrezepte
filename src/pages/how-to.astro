              Documentation: iframe "allow" attribute

              The "allow" attribute on an <iframe> declares a Permissions Policy for the embedded context.
              It lists, as a semicolon- or space-separated set of feature tokens, which browser features the framed
              content is permitted to use. This does not override browser-wide privacy settings or user preferences;
              it only grants permission from the embedding document's side.

              Features present in the selection:
              - accelerometer: access to device motion sensors (acceleration).
              - gyroscope: access to device orientation/rotation sensors.
              - autoplay: allow media to play automatically (subject to browser autoplay policies).
              - clipboard-write: allow writing to the system clipboard via the Clipboard API.
              - encrypted-media: allow use of Encrypted Media Extensions (DRM-protected playback).
              - picture-in-picture: allow using Picture-in-Picture for video elements.
              - web-share: allow invoking the Web Share API to share content from the iframe.

              Notes:
              - Some features can also be controlled with more granular directives (origins/values) via a full
                Permissions-Policy header or more specific allow syntax.
              - Fullscreen is commonly enabled with the separate allowfullscreen attribute (or by allowing
                the "fullscreen" feature in a Permissions Policy).
